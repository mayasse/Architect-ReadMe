# Hello, I'm Mark
Hi, I look forward to knowing you better, and please be confident that this document is not intended to replace the relationship we will build as we work together. I intend this document to give you insight into my thoughts about how I like to work and how I think.  As we build trust I would like your input about how accurate this document is.

# My Vision (2021)
For Monotype to be a Company that employs the best software architectures and technologies to support its mission, and to excel at converting expertise into software.

For myself to be an enterprise architect that:
- Gains the trust of the implementors and business owners equally.
- Oversees Monotype's technical approach such that Monotype reaches its goals.
- Recreates this role in others.

# My role as a Software Architect
My #1 goal is to make our team successful and happy. I believe working on things that both provide value to our customers and use each individual's strengths is a good way to do that.  Particularly:
1. I enjoy my work, and I want you to enjoy yours.  I love helping people develop their skills.
1. I want to make sure that our team understands the needs of our business, and that the business understands your needs.
1. I write a little code occasionally, and I would enjoy reviewing your code because I know it will teach me something.
1. It is much more interesting for me to see how you would solve a problem than for me to tell you "the answer".  Please, do not confuse that with avoiding responsibility: I stand with our team's decisions, and I will "go to bat" for you.

# Hours
I am available typically from 6:30 am eastern to 15:30 pm eastern US time.  This is so that I am available for those in India late in their day.  I work from home frequently to save 3 hours of commute time, but I make it my goal to be in the office all day Thursday at the very least, and I will almost always be working from home on Friday.  As for your own schedule: I hope you make your home life a priority, and let me know what works for you in preparation for times we may need to meet.

# Communication
I respond to email and IM, but if possible I prefer face-to-face communication even if it is through a computer screen.  I am surprised at how many new things I learn about you when I meet you in person, and I think that is valuable time if we can get it.  I like to have weekly one on ones with the people with whom I work most frequently.  I also like small regular group meetings especially if they have a strong purpose.

# Feedback
Please give me some... thanks!  Generally I am insecure, therefore the more feedback I get from you the better.  It lets me know where I stand, helps build trust between us, and will help make it easier when you finally have something hard to say to me...

# About me
I place stong emphasis on relationships and values.

I hope to be persuasive about my ideas, and able to be persuaded by you.

I like to keep active: beyond hitting the gym on week days my current "sport" (another one for my 'collection'?) is free-climbing.
I used to play soccer, I used to study tae kwon do, sail boats, etc.
I also really enjoy cooking and collect new cooking ideas from wherever I go.

I have 3 grown children, and 2 grandchildren.
